This example shows a very over-engineered distributed tic-tac-toe
game.

Compile the IDL in tictactoe.idl, then run gameServer.py. Now start
some instances of gameClient.py. The client has a user interface for
creating new games, joining existing games, and watching games.

This is not a particularly sensible implementation of such a simple
game, but it demonstrates many techniques that are useful in large
applications.
