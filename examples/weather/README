Before AT&T Laboratories Cambridge closed, it ran a live weather
service with web and CORBA interfaces. The web interface lives on,
hosted by the Laboratory for Communications Engineering in Cambridge
University, but the CORBA interface unfortunately does not.

This directory contains an example client that used to connect to the
live weather service. That is no longer possible, but you can use the
weather server to create your own weather. Drag the hands of the
displayed gauges to choose the weather you would like. Give the IOR of
the server to the client on its command line.

Before you can run the programs, you must compile the IDL with

  omniidl -bpython weatherInfo.idl
