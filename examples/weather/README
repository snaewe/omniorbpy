This directory contains an example client to the CORBA weather service
running at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. If you run the client with no
arguments, it uses a built-in IOR to connect to the AT&T weather
server. If you provide a command line argument containing an IOR, it
will contact that server instead.

There is also a server program which you can use to create your own
weather. Drag the hands of the displayed gauges to choose the weather
you would like.

Before you can run the programs, you must compile the IDL with

  omniidl -bpython weatherInfo.idl
