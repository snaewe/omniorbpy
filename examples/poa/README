This directory contains examples of using ServantActivators and
ServantLocators. Both example programs implement the Echo server, with
on-demand object activation.

If you run either program with a -l command line argument, it will
make a number of local calls to the object, showing that the activator
or locator runs in the local, as well as the remote, case.

These examples only work if you are using omniORB 3.0. omniORB 2.8
does not support these POA-only facilities.

Before the programs will run, you must compile the IDL with

  omniidl -bpython echo.idl
