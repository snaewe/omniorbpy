This little example provides an omniORBpy client to the random number
server running on random.org.

To run the example, you must first compile the Python stubs from
random.idl, with

  omniidl -bpython random.idl

Then simply run the client with ./random_clt.py

Using omniORBpy reveals a bug in Orbix 2.3 running on random.org. The
first time omniORBpy makes a call to a remote object, it calls the
standard _is_a() operation to verify that the object is alive and
supports the required interface. Unfortunately, Orbix 2.3 incorrectly
returns FALSE to this _is_a() call. random_clt.py therefore configures
the ORB not to perform the _is_a() call.
