<H1 CLASS="chapter"><A NAME="htoc1">Chapter&#XA0;1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Introduction</H1><P>omniORBpy is an Object Request Broker (ORB) that implements the CORBA
2.6 Python mapping&#XA0;[<A HREF="omniORBpy011.html#pythonmapping">OMG01b</A>]. It works in conjunction with
omniORB for C++, version 4.1.</P><P>This user guide tells you how to use omniORBpy to develop CORBA
applications using Python. It assumes a basic understanding of CORBA,
and of the Python mapping. Unlike most CORBA standards, the Python
mapping document is small, and quite easy to follow.</P><P>This manual contains all you need to know about omniORB in order to
use omniORBpy. Some sections are repeated from the omniORB manual.</P><P>In this chapter, we give an overview of the main features of omniORBpy
and what you need to do to setup your environment to run it.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc1"></A><A NAME="htoc2">1.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Features</H2><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc3">1.1.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Multithreading</H3><P>omniORB is fully multithreaded. To achieve low call overhead,
unnecessary call-multiplexing is eliminated. With the default
policies, there is at most one call in-flight in each communication
channel between two address spaces at any one time. To do this without
limiting the level of concurrency, new channels connecting the two
address spaces are created on demand and cached when there are
concurrent calls in progress. Each channel is served by a dedicated
thread. This arrangement provides maximal concurrency and eliminates
any thread switching in either of the address spaces to process a
call. Furthermore, to maximise the throughput in processing large call
arguments, large data elements are sent as soon as they are processed
while the other arguments are being marshalled. With GIOP 1.2, large
messages are fragmented, so the marshaller can start transmission
before it knows how large the entire message will be.</P><P>From version 4.0 onwards, omniORB also supports a flexible thread
pooling policy, and supports sending multiple interleaved calls on a
single connection. This policy leads to a small amount of additional
call overhead, compared to the default thread per connection model,
but allows omniORB to scale to extremely large numbers of concurrent
clients.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc4">1.1.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Portability</H3><P>omniORB has always been designed to be portable. It runs on many
flavours of Unix, Windows, several embedded operating systems, and
relatively obscure systems such as OpenVMS and Fujitsu-Siemens BS2000.
It is designed to be easy to port to new platforms. The IDL to C++
mapping for all target platforms is the same.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc5">1.1.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Missing features</H3><P>
<A NAME="sec:missing"></A></P><P>omniORB is not (yet) a complete implementation of the CORBA 2.6 core.
The following is a list of the most significant missing features.</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">omniORB does not have its own Interface Repository. However, it
can act as a client to an IfR. The omniifr project
(<A HREF="http://omniifr.sourceforge.net/"><TT>http://omniifr.sourceforge.net/</TT></A>) aims to create an IfR for
omniORB.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">omniORB supports interceptors, but not the standard Portable
Interceptor API. Interceptor facilities available from Python code are
quite limited.</LI></UL><P>These features may be implemented in the short to medium term. It is
best to check out the latest status on the omniORB home page
(<A HREF="http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/"><TT>http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/</TT></A>).</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc2"></A><A NAME="htoc6">1.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Setting up your environment</H2><P>
<A NAME="sec:setup"></A></P><P>omniORBpy relies on the omniORB C++ libraries. If you are building
from source, you must first build omniORB itself, as detailed in the
omniORB documentation. After that, you can build the omniORBpy
distribution, according to the instructions in the release notes.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc7">1.2.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Paths</H3><P>With an Autoconf build (the norm on Unix platforms), omniORBpy is
usually installed into a location that Python will find it.</P><P>Otherwise, you must tell Python where to find it. You must add two
directories to the <TT>PYTHONPATH</TT> environment variable. The
<TT>lib/python</TT> directory contains platform-independent Python code;
the <TT>lib/</TT><TT>$</TT><TT>FARCH</TT> directory contains
platform-specific binaries, where <TT>FARCH</TT> is the name of
your platform, such as <TT>x86_win32</TT>.</P><P>On Unix platforms, set <TT>PYTHONPATH</TT> with a command like:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$TOP/lib/python:$TOP/lib/$FARCH
</PRE><P>On Windows, use</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%TOP%\lib\python;%TOP%\lib\x86_win32
</PRE><P>(Where the <TT>TOP</TT> environment variable is the root of your
omniORB tree.)</P><P>You should also add the <TT>bin/</TT><TT>$</TT><TT>FARCH</TT> directory
to your <TT>PATH</TT>, so you can run the IDL compiler, omniidl.
Finally, add the <TT>lib/</TT><TT>$</TT><TT>FARCH</TT> directory to
<TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT>, so the omniORB core library can be found.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc8">1.2.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Configuration file</H3><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">On Unix platforms, the omniORB runtime looks for the environment
variable <TT>OMNIORB_CONFIG</TT>. If this variable is defined, it
contains the pathname of the omniORB configuration file. If the
variable is not set, omniORB will use the compiled-in pathname to
locate the file (by default <TT>/etc/omniORB.cfg</TT>).</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">On Win32 platforms (Windows NT, 2000, 95, 98), omniORB first
checks the environment variable <TT>OMNIORB_CONFIG</TT> to obtain the
pathname of the configuration file. If this is not set, it then
attempts to obtain configuration data in the system registry. It
searches for the data under the key
<TT>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\omniORB</TT>.</LI></UL><P>omniORB has a large number of parameters than can be configured. See
chapter&#XA0;<A HREF="omniORBpy004.html#chap:config">4</A> for full details. The files
<TT>sample.cfg</TT> and <TT>sample.reg</TT> contain an example
configuration file and set of registry entries respectively.</P><P>To get all the omniORB examples running, the main thing you need to
configure is the Naming service, omniNames. To do that, the
configuration file or registry should contain an entry of the form</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">  InitRef = NameService=corbaname::my.host.name
</PRE><P>See section&#XA0;<A HREF="omniORBpy006.html#sec:corbaname">6.1.2</A> for full details of corbaname URIs.</P><HR>
