<bug id="3" date="Wed Jul 19 18:03:11 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>ImportError due to undefined symbols</summary>
  <text>
  If you have patched omniORB 3.0.0 to fix <a
  href="../omniORBbug.html#bug5">bug 5</a>, you will see undefined
  symbols for things to do with tracedmutex or tracedcondition when
  you try to import the omniORBpy modules. To fix this, make a clean
  build of omniORBpy, with "<code>make clean; make export</code>".

  <summary>omniidl name look-up is more strict</summary>
  <text>
  When looking-up a name, omniidl now raises an error if a name which
  differs only in case is found along the look-up path. Before, it
  would ignore the name and continue until an exact match was found.
