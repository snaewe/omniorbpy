  <summary>Interface Repository stubs not available with "import
  CORBA"</summary>
  <reported>Richard Gruet</reported>
  <text>
  The <code>OMNIORBPY_IMPORT_IR_STUBS</code> environment variable
  worked with "<code>from omniORB import CORBA</code>", but not
  "<code>import CORBA</code>".

  <summary>Instability after unexpected user exceptions</summary>
  <text>
  After the fix on 17 August (see the update.log), when an unexpected
  user exception was raised in an up-call, the Python error status
  would not be properly cleared. This meant that later up-calls could
  fail with exceptions of the form "AttributeError: minor", even when
  the code didn't mention "minor" at all.

  <summary>omniidl back-end generates useless classes for typedef to
  struct/union</summary>

  <reported>Jimmy Wilson</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-08/0172.html"/>
  <text>
  The Python mapping specification is totally silent on the issue of
  typedefs. The only thing it says is that <em>something</em> must be
  generated for all declared types, to be passed to
  <code>CORBA.id()</code>. It does make sense to allow typedef names
  to be used to contruct structs and unions, though.
